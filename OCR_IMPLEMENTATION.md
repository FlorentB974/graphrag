# OCR Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality as part of the document ingestion pipeline with two main purposes:
1. **Understanding scanned documents** - Extract text from low-quality scanned PDFs and remove poor chunks
2. **Understanding diagrams** - Extract text from images and diagrams within documents

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core OCR Module (`core/ocr.py`)
- **OCRProcessor class** with comprehensive OCR functionality
- **Text quality assessment** - Evaluates chunks for OCR artifacts and poor quality
- **Image enhancement** - Applies preprocessing techniques for better OCR accuracy
- **Scanned PDF processing** - Converts PDF pages to images and applies OCR
- **Image extraction** - Extracts and processes embedded images from PDFs
- **Standalone image processing** - Handles image files directly
- **Chunk quality filtering** - Identifies and removes low-quality chunks after entity extraction

Key Features:
- Adaptive thresholding and noise reduction for better OCR
- Quality metrics calculation (text ratio, whitespace ratio, fragmentation)
- Configurable quality thresholds
- Support for multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, BMP)

### 2. Enhanced PDF Loader (`ingestion/loaders/enhanced_pdf_loader.py`)
- **Hybrid approach** - Uses regular text extraction for good quality pages, OCR for scanned pages
- **Automatic detection** - Identifies which pages need OCR processing
- **Image processing** - Extracts and processes embedded images/diagrams
- **Quality reporting** - Provides metadata about processing methods used

### 3. Enhanced Chunking (`core/enhanced_chunking.py`)
- **Quality-aware chunking** - Incorporates quality assessment into chunk creation
- **Post-processing filtering** - Removes chunks with poor quality and no entities
- **Quality metrics** - Tracks and reports chunk quality statistics
- **Multimodal support** - Handles text from multiple sources (text extraction + OCR)

### 4. Updated Document Processor (`ingestion/document_processor.py`)
- **Integrated OCR support** - Uses enhanced PDF loader and chunking
- **Image file support** - Processes standalone image files with OCR
- **Configurable processing** - Can enable/disable OCR and quality filtering
- **Quality tracking** - Reports on processing methods used

## Configuration Options

Added to `config/settings.py`:
```python
# OCR Configuration
enable_ocr: bool = True                    # Enable OCR processing
enable_quality_filtering: bool = True      # Enable chunk quality filtering  
ocr_quality_threshold: float = 0.6        # Quality threshold for processing
```

## Dependencies Added

Added to `requirements.txt`:
```
# OCR and image processing
pytesseract>=0.3.10    # Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR
Pillow>=10.0.0         # Python Imaging Library for image processing
pdf2image>=1.17.0      # Convert PDF pages to images
opencv-python>=4.8.0   # Computer vision library for image enhancement
```

System dependency: `poppler-utils` (for pdf2image)

## How It Works

### 1. Document Processing Flow
```
PDF Document → Enhanced PDF Loader
    ↓
Regular Text Extraction (for clear pages)
    +
OCR Processing (for scanned pages)  
    +  
Image/Diagram Extraction & OCR
    ↓
Combined Text Content → Enhanced Chunking
    ↓
Quality Assessment & Filtering
    ↓
Entity Extraction
    ↓
Post-Processing Quality Filter
    ↓
Final High-Quality Chunks
```

### 2. Quality Assessment Metrics
- **Text Ratio**: Proportion of alphanumeric characters (min: 0.1)
- **Whitespace Ratio**: Proportion of whitespace characters (max: 0.7)
- **Fragmentation**: Ratio of very short words indicating OCR errors
- **Artifacts**: Detection of non-ASCII characters from poor OCR
- **Overall Quality Score**: Weighted combination (0.0 - 1.0)

### 3. Chunk Filtering Logic
Chunks are marked for removal if:
- Quality score < 0.3 AND
- No entities extracted AND  
- No relationships extracted AND
- Content length < 50 characters

## Test Results

The test suite demonstrates:
- ✅ Basic OCR quality assessment working correctly
- ✅ Enhanced PDF loader processing scanned documents (65 OCR pages detected)
- ✅ Image/diagram text extraction (1 image section detected) 
- ✅ Quality-aware chunking (355 chunks created, 96 needing review)
- ✅ Post-entity filtering removing poor quality chunks

## Usage Examples

### Processing a Scanned PDF
```python
from ingestion.loaders.pdf_loader import PDFLoader

loader = PDFLoader()
content = loader.load("scanned_document.pdf")
# Returns text with OCR markers: "--- Page 1 (OCR) ---"
```

### Processing an Image File
```python
from core.ocr import ocr_processor

text = ocr_processor.process_standalone_image("diagram.png")
# Returns extracted text from the image
```

### Quality Assessment  
```python
from core.ocr import ocr_processor

assessment = ocr_processor.assess_chunk_quality(chunk_text)
# Returns: {quality_score, needs_ocr, reason, metrics}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Text Extraction**: Scanned documents now contribute meaningful content instead of being ignored
2. **Diagram Understanding**: Text within diagrams, charts, and images is now accessible
3. **Quality Control**: Poor quality chunks that would confuse entity extraction are automatically filtered
4. **Multimodal Processing**: Combines traditional text extraction with OCR for comprehensive document understanding
5. **Configurable**: OCR can be enabled/disabled based on requirements and computational resources

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Advanced image detection to distinguish text from graphics
- Support for table extraction from images
- Multi-language OCR support
- Integration with specialized OCR engines for different document types
- Machine learning-based quality assessment
