# v1.1.0 (2025-09-28)

This release introduces hybrid entity retrieval, entity extraction and tracking, token management improvements, performance optimizations, and several UI/readability fixes.

## Highlights

- Hybrid entity retrieval and extraction
  - Add entity extraction pipeline with background processing and status updates.
  - Implement entity normalization and deduplication to improve result quality.
  - Add entity ID retrieval from names and improve logging for retrieval processes.

- Retrieval improvements
  - Introduce hybrid retrieval mode with reduced expand depth for performance.
  - Add a minimum similarity threshold to filter low-quality chunks.
  - Enhance retrieval logic to exclude low-similarity chunks from response generation.

- Token management and LLM handling
  - Ensure model type conversion to string in OpenAI response generation.
  - Implement safe fallbacks for truncated responses and output token management.
  - Parallelize LLM calls for entity extraction where applicable.

- Performance and reliability
  - Parallelize embedding generation for entity mode.
  - Add embedding validation and exponential backoff.
  - Reduce expand depth in hybrid retrieval mode to improve performance.

- UI and UX improvements
  - Limit displayed entities and chunks to 10 for improved UI readability.
  - Fix source display and improve graph readability.
  - Implement status updates for entity extraction operations in the UI.

- Misc and housekeeping
  - Several code cleanups and logging enhancements.
  - Merge updates from `main` and minor fixes.
