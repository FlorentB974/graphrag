# v1.2.0 (2025-10-06)

Brief changelog (changes since v1.1.0):

## Key new functionalities

- OCR & document processing
  - Added `core/ocr.py` and improved PDF/image loaders to support Smart OCR and layout-aware text reconstruction.
  - Improved preprocessing for multi-column and noisy scans (see `ingestion/loaders/image_loader.py`, updated `pdf_loader.py`).

- Follow-up questions & conversational context
  - Implemented follow-up detection and contextual query rewriting to better handle multi-turn interactions (see `docs/FOLLOW_UP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`).
  - Retrieval now preserves chat context to surface more relevant chunks and entities.

- Answer quality scoring
  - Introduced an asynchronous quality scoring system (`core/quality_scorer.py`) that requests an LLM-based score while responses stream to users, avoiding blocking the generation path.
  - Moved scoring out of the synchronous generation node and updated UI wiring to show scores when available.

## Other notable changes

- UI code refactoring
- New/updated docs: `docs/OCR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `docs/QUALITY_SCORE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, and follow-up docs.

See commits between v1.1.0 and v1.2.0 for full details (notable commits: "Implement OCR and enhance document processing", "Implement follow-up questions support", "Add answer quality scoring and refactor UI components").
