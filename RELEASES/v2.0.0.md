# v2.0.0 (2025-11-01)

Brief changelog (changes since v1.2.0):

## Key new functionalities

### 🎨 Complete UI Overhaul

- **Modern Next.js Frontend**: Replaced Streamlit with a state-of-the-art Next.js 14 application featuring React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Streaming**: Token-by-token response streaming with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for immediate feedback
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished user experience with Framer Motion animations and transitions

### 💬 Enhanced Chat Experience

- **Follow-up Questions**: AI-generated contextual follow-up question suggestions after each response
- **Chat History Management**: Persistent conversation storage in Neo4j with session management, search, and deletion capabilities
- **Contextual Query Rewriting**: Automatic detection and contextualization of follow-up questions using conversation history
- **Quality Scoring**: Real-time answer quality assessment with detailed breakdown (context relevance, completeness, factual grounding, coherence, citation quality)

### 📚 Advanced Document Management

- **Document Preview**: In-app document viewing with chunk text, extracted entities, related documents, and live previews without leaving the chat context
- **Summary Extraction**: Automatic document summary generation during ingestion
- **Tag Extraction**: Intelligent tag extraction for better document organization and search
- **Context Restriction**: Ability to restrict context by specifying documents or tags in chat queries

### 🔍 Enhanced Retrieval & Reasoning

- **Hybrid Entity-Chunk Retrieval**: Combines chunk-based and entity-based retrieval methods with configurable weights
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Advanced graph traversal for complex queries with beam search and configurable depth
- **Graph Expansion**: Entity relationship exploration for enriched context with configurable expansion limits
- **Smart OCR Processing**: Intelligent OCR that automatically detects when and where to apply OCR, preserving readable text while processing images and scanned content

### ⚙️ Improved Configuration & Performance

- **Feature Flags**: Granular control over features like entity extraction, quality scoring, and delete operations
- **Rate Limiting Improvements**: Enhanced rate limiting with configurable delays and thread-safe request management to prevent API rate limit violations
- **Optimized Processing**: Better concurrency controls and performance optimizations throughout the pipeline

### 🏗️ Architecture Modernization

- **FastAPI Backend**: RESTful API with automatic OpenAPI documentation and SSE streaming support
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between frontend, backend, and core processing components
- **Enhanced Database Schema**: Extended Neo4j schema supporting conversations, entities, relationships, and metadata
- **Docker Support**: Complete containerization with Docker Compose for easy deployment

## Other notable changes

- **Entity Extraction**: LLM-powered entity and relationship extraction with importance scoring and concurrent processing
- **Quality Scoring System**: Asynchronous quality assessment that doesn't block response generation
- **Conversation Persistence**: Full chat history storage with metadata and search capabilities
- **Document Intelligence**: Enhanced document processing with summaries, tags, and intelligent chunking
- **API Endpoints**: Comprehensive REST API for chat, history, database management, and document operations
- **Environment Configuration**: Comprehensive environment variable management with feature toggles
- **Development Experience**: Improved setup scripts, documentation, and development workflow
